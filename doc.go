//
// This library is trying to be feature complete and up to date with current standard to let everything a browser having to offect be available in WebAssembly in a Go API accessable. To achive this most
// of the code is [generated](https://github.com/gowebapi/webidlgenerator) from [WebIDL files](https://github.com/gowebapi/idl). WebIDL files can be found in different standard making it easiser to be up to date than handwritten binding code.
